title: February Meeting - Post FOSDEM Viewing Party

The next ScotLUG is on Thursday, 25th February 2021.
This month we will be starting the meeting at 6PM, where we will again have a viewing party of some recent conference talks. With FOSDEM now finishing up after an excellent weekend of talks, I'm sure we can pick out some really interesting ones.
