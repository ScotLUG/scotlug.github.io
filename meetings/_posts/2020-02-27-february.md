title: February Pub Meet
---

The next ScotLUG will be on 27th February 2020. Unfortunately, we do not have a talk scheduled this month.

We will be meeting at Henglers Circus on Sauchiehall Street at 7PM. We will not meet up at the Electron Club this month.

You will likely find us at the tables, up the small stairs to the right-hand side of the main entrance. There is of course, no obligation to have drinks or food if you want to come along.
