title: End of Year Gathering
---

The next ScotLUG will be on 19th December. This month, we will be meeting up a little earlier given that people tend to have commitments towards the end of December.

We will be meeting at Henglers Circus on Sauchiehall Street at 7PM. We will not meet up at the Electron Club this month.

There is of course, no obligation to have drinks or food if you want to come along.

Hope to see you there.
