title: Planning 2020 - 2021
---

Our next meeting will be on Thursday 27th August.

We will be kicking off another year of ScotLUG. As we’ve done over the past few years, we have used or first meeting of the academic year to plan,or at least set forward a roadmap of the coming year.

If you’ve got any ideas for talks, or anything you want to bring up on the night – let me know!

We’re going to have a 20 minute session at the end for a Linux or Open Source Q&A session. It is our hope that you can use this time to work on/ with a project that you’re really passionate about, if not get advice on how to go about doing this.

We will be meeting on <a href="https://scotlug.org.uk/meeting/20200827">https://scotlug.org.uk/meeting/20200827</a> at 7PM.
