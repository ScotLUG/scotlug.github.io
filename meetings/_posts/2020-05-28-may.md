title: Introduction to Rust
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 28th May. This month, we have Chris Zimmerman presenting a talk, introducing the Rust language.

This presentation will be a short introduction to this up-and-coming system language aimed at high performance and parallel computing. After a short overview, the main language concepts are described followed by an outline of the ecosystem of the language (including the package management, build system, etc.). Time permitting, the presentation concludes with an example of a simple web server followed by Q&A.
