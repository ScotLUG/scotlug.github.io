The next ScotLUG will be on 1st December 2022. This month, we will be meeting up at the beginning of month given that people tend to have commitments towards the end of December.

This month we will be attempting day one of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022" title="Advent of Code: 2022">Advent of Code</a>, which is annual advent calendar of small programming puzzles.

In true geek tradition Quiz Master Fred will be encouraging you to attempt to solve the puzzle in

<ul><li>bash</li><li><abbr title="LISP is the answer">emacs</abbr></li><li>haskell</li><li>lua</li><li>python</li><li>perl</li><li>rust</li><li>Unix tools</li><li>...</li></ul>

As well as solving day one of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022" title="Advent of Code: 2022">Advent of Code</a>, we will also be available to answer any Linux queries you may have.
