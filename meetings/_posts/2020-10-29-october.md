The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 29th October. We wont be having a meeting this month.

During our last meeting, we spent some time planning out how we would like this year to be scheduled. So far we have the following schedule. We’re looking for volunteers for all of the talks where the speaker is TBD, please get in touch if you’re interested, or would like to propose an alternative.

 * October: Kenny C and Kenny D - Online Videoconferencing / BigBlueButton
 * November: Fred Crowson - OpenBSD
 * December: Remote Social Event
 * January: Kenny C - Live Streaming of Free Software Events
 * February: TBD - Linux and Operational Security
 * March: TBD - Linux from Scratch
 * April: TBD - April fools RFC
 * May: TBD - Kubernetes, what is it? Do we need it?
 * June: TBD - Software Defined Radio

We also discussed our plans for this year given the current situation. We have decided that we will continue meeting online, and review this in the new year.
