title: Remote Lightning Talks
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 30th April. Unfortunately, we will not be able to meet in person. Instead, we will be using video conference software to run a remote meeting.

This month, there has been a slight change of plan and we are now looking for a series of 5 to 10-minute lightning talks from both new and regular members. There are no defined parameters for a subject, so it doesn't need to be strictly about Linux, a relation to free and open-source software/hardware would, of course, be preferred.

If you're interested in presenting a talk, the CFP form can be found at:

<strong>More details to follow closer to the event!</strong>

Looking forward to catching up with you all.
