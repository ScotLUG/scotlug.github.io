title: End of Year Gathering
---

The next ScotLUG will be on 17th December. This month, we will be meeting up a little earlier given that people tend to have commitments towards the end of December.

This month we will be starting the meeting at 6PM, where we will be watching a recent talk from one of the many excellent conferences that have happened in 2020. Suggestions Welcome!
