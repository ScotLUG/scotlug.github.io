title: Quarter of Century of OpenBSD
---

Our next meeting will be on Thursday 26th November. We will again be using video conference software to run a remote meeting.

This month we will be starting the meeting at 6PM, where we will be watching a recent talk on the state of Linux in 2020, followed by a live talk from one of our regulars, Fred Crowson.

Fred will be presenting a talk on the OpenBSD. OpenBSD had itâ€™s 25th Birthday back in October, to celebrate Fred is going to run through installing OpenBSD, on some real or virtual hardware, so that everyone can follow along at home, or in the cloud :~)
