title: Operating Systems Foundations with Linux on the Raspberry Pi
---

Hi Folks,

Happy new year!

The next ScotLUG will be on Thursday 30th January. This month, we have Jeremy Singer from the University of Glasgow presenting his talk on his new book: Operating Systems Foundations with Linux on the Raspberry Pi. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

Why are processes like whales? How does interrupt-driven IO remind you of a parcel depot? These and other analogies are used to explain the complex notions of operating systems in a learner-friendly, accessible way.

In this talk, Jeremy will discuss how his team produced a new textbook on operating systems which has a highly practical focus, with a series of Linux case studies that readers are encouraged to explore on the Raspberry Pi platform. The book has 11 chapters, covering traditional OS content like process scheduling, memory management and file systems, along with more modern material like file systems in user space, docker containers and processor security vulnerability mitigation. For more details, you can visit http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/operating-systems-foundations/

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to Henglers Circus, across the road from the CCA. There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.

Hope to see you all there.
