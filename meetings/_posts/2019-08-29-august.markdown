title: Planning 2019 - 2020
---

The next ScotLUG meeting will be on Thursday 20th August at the usual spot, the Electron Club in the CCA. We should be kicking around the Electron Club around 7:00PM.

In line with the past few years, the first meeting after summer has been our planning meeting. We will be getting together to come up with a suggested talk plan and try to flesh out some new ideas for the coming year.

Following the talk we will be adjourning to a local bar, this is likely to Henglers Circus, across the road from the CCA. There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.

Hope to see you all there.
