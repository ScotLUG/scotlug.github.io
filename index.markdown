ScotLUG wishes everyone a Happy New Year!

We hope to organise our first meeting of the year on Thursday, 23 Feb 23...

Meetings are usually held at 19:00, with the talk beginning at 19:30, every last Thursday of the month at the [Electron Club][].  Check out our past meetings, what's on this month, and what might be coming up on our [meetings](/meetings) page.

Our IRC channel, [#scotlug][], is usually helpful.  There is a [mailing list][] for general announcements.

In addition to Glasgow, [Falkirk][] and [Edinburgh][] both have active Linux User Groups.  The [UK Linux User Groups organisation][] has a list of other [user groups across Scotland][].
