If you have an interest in free and open-source software you are welcome to come along to a meeting, or hang out with us on <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>.  There are generally several dozen members idling in the channel who are happy to provide help, advice and information on software and hardware issues.

Meetings are fun and informal, and we are always looking for interesting talks and show-and-tells.  If you have project that you would like to share with us, or subject that you are passionate about, we would love to hear about it!

## Meeting Format

We normally meet at the venue around 7PM, aiming to start talks around 7:30PM.

At the start of each meeting, there will be a set of post-it notes on the middle table in the venue. If you have any questions, or are looking for some advice, please note it down on one of these. At the end of the talk, we will read through these and try to help as best we can as a collective group.

Our schedule for each event is generally:

* 7:00PM - Venue Open
* 7:30PM - Talk, Workshop or Guided Discussion
* 8:30PM - Linux / FLOSS Q&A
* 8:45PM - Adjourn to the Pub

There is no requirement to purchase food or drink if you don't want to.
